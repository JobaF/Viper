# Analytics and Applications Team Assignment

1. Data Collection and Preparation:
- ~~Get [bike sharing data set](https://data.deutschebahn.com/dataset/data-call-a-bike)~~
- ~~Get [temperature data set](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/hourly/precipitation/historical/)~~
- ~~Get [precipitation data set](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/hourly/air_temperature/historical/)~~
- Get more data sets (?)
- ~~Select the city and year in the bike sharing data set~~
- Clean the data sets:
  - ~~check for missing values~~
  - ~~edit missing values~~
  - ~~delete unneeded columns~~
  - ~~use right datatypes~~
  - use memory efficiently
  
> "You have been provided with a full dataset of bike sharing rentals. Select the city and year you have been allocated and clean your dataset for use in later stages of your project. To obtain Weather data access the open data portal of the German Weather Service (DWD)."

2. Descriptive Analytics:
- Find patterns in seasonal (spring, summer, autumn, winter), weekly (monday-sunday) and daily level (0:00-23:59)
  - start times
  - trip length
  - start and end location
- Give reasons for the found patterns

> "Analyze the bike rental demand patterns for the relevant one-year period and city (please check carefully which city your team has been allocated). Specifically show how rental patterns (such as start time, trip length, start and end location) for the given sample varies on a seasonal, weekly and daily level. Give possible reasons for the observed patterns."
  
  
3. Cluster Analysis:
-

> "Based on the bike rental demand patterns, can you identify clusters of trip types and/or customer types? How would you label these clusters? Can you cluster the locations based on their demand pattern?"


4. Predictive Analytics:

> "Develop a prediction model that predicts bike rental demand as a function of suitable features available in or derived from the datasets.
– Why did you choose a specific regression type? Clearly justify your choice of regression method and describe its advantages over other methods.
– How good is your model? Evaluate your model’s performance and comment on its shortfalls.
– Show how you model’s performance varies as you increase or decrease temporal resolution for the following period length:1h, 2h, 6h, 24h.
– How could the model be improved further? Explain some of the improvement levers that you might focus on in a follow-up project."


5. Discussion and Outlook:

> "Discuss the implications of your results for the fleet operator. Which further analysis would you consider useful and could be conducted on the given dataset?"
